Chenchen really did a good job, and there are some improving suggestions:

1. Add a makefile to help compiling LaTeX, users can use `make` command to compile and get the pdf output, take a look at the example `Makefile`.
2. Add a `.gitignore` file, `git` will ignore files listed in `.gitignore`, take a look at the example `.gitignore`.
3. Chenchen can imitate `na1_example.tex` to format the LaTeX file better.
4. Add a `README.md` file to Chenchen's repo, and describe this repo.
