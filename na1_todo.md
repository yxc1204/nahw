Chenchen really did a good job, and there are some improving suggestions:

1. Add a `.gitignore` file, `git` will ignore files listed in `.gitignore`, take a look at the example `.gitignore`.
2. Chenchen can imitate `na1_example.tex` to format the LaTeX file better.
3. Add a `README.md` file to Chenchen's repo, and describe this repo.
